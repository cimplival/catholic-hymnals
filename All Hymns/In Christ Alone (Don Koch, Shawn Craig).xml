    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>In Christ alone I place my trust<br/>And find my glory in the power of the cross<br/>In ev'ry victory let it be said of me<br/>My source of strength my source of hope<br/>Is Christ alone</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In Christ alone will I glory<br/>Though I could pride myself in battles won<br/>For I've been blessed beyond measure<br/>And by His strength alone I overcome<br/>Oh I could stop and count successes<br/>Like diamonds in my hand<br/>But those trophies could not equal<br/>To the grace by which I stand</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In Christ alone will I glory<br/>For only by His grace I am redeemed<br/>And only His tender mercy<br/>Could reach beyond my weakness to my need<br/>Now I seek no greater honor<br/>Than just to know Him more<br/>And to count my gains<br/>But losses to the glory of my Lord</lines>
    </verse>
