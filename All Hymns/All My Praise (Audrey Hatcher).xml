    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Holy my God You are worthy<br/>Of all my praise<br/>Holy my God You are worthy<br/>Of all my praise</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I will follow You through green pastures<br/>And sing hallelujah to Your name<br/>I will follow You through dark disaster<br/>And sing hallelujah through the pain<br/>And even in the shadow of death I will praise You<br/>And even in the valley I will say</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You are seated on Your throne in heaven<br/>And You see all of us down here<br/>And You have promised You will not abandon<br/>So I shall not fear<br/>And even in the shadow of death<br/>I will praise You<br/>And even in the valley I will say</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>You made ev'ry star<br/>And You taught it how to shine<br/>You knew my name before there was time<br/>And all this was just part of Your glorious design<br/>Hallelujah<br/>Hallelujah</lines>
