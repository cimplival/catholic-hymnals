    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Oh God You are my God<br/>And I will ever praise You<br/>Oh God You are my God<br/>And I will ever praise You<br/>I will seek You in the morning<br/>And I will learn to walk in Your ways<br/>And step by step You'll lead me<br/>And I will follow You all of my days</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Sometimes the night was beautiful<br/>Sometimes the sky was so far away<br/>Sometimes it seemed too steep<br/>So close you could touch it<br/>But your heart would break<br/>Sometimes the morning came too soon<br/>Sometimes the day could be so hard<br/>There was so much work left to do<br/>But so much you'd already done</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Sometimes I think of Abraham<br/>How one star he saw had been lit for him<br/>He was a stranger in this land<br/>And I am that no less than he<br/>And on this road to righteousness<br/>Sometimes the climb can be steep<br/>I may falter in my steps<br/>But never beyond reach</lines>
