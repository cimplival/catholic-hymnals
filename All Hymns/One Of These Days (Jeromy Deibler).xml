    <verse name="c1a">
      <lines>One of these days<br/>I'm gonna see the hand<br/>That took the nails for me<br/>One of these days<br/>I'm gonna hold the key<br/>Of the mansion built for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1b">
      <lines>One of these days<br/>I'm gonna walk the streets of gold<br/>That were paved for me<br/>One of these days<br/>I'm gonna see my Savior face to face<br/>One of these days</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>One of these days I'm gonna fly<br/>Over the mountain<br/>One of these days I'm gonna ride<br/>On the silver lining<br/>One of these days I'm gonna witness<br/>All I've been missing<br/>One of these days</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>One of these days I'm gonna do<br/>All the things that I've never done<br/>I'm gonna finish all the races<br/>That I've run but I've never won<br/>And I'm gonna see a million faces<br/>And recognize everyone<br/>One of these days</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>One of these days I'm gonna say<br/>Just what became of me<br/>On the day that I believed<br/>When You took myself from me<br/>And I believe I will say<br/>What I would have been<br/>If You didn't save me<br/>One of these days</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>And one of these days I'm gonna talk<br/>With all the saints<br/>That have gone before<br/>And in their sandals I will walk<br/>And we will sit along the shore<br/>And I will learn all the things<br/>That I never knew before<br/>All this and more</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>One of these days I'll finally be<br/>In a place where<br/>There's no more need<br/>No more pain and no more grief<br/>No more foolish disbelief<br/>And all the joy there will be<br/>When at last we finally see<br/>One of these days</lines>
    </verse>
