  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>A lonely hill<br/>A rugged tree<br/>Time stands still and waits for my answer<br/>This sacrifice is calling me to a life<br/>Of total surrender</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>The power of the cross is moving in my life<br/>'Cause the power of Your blood has saved me<br/>The power of the cross still draws me to Your side<br/>'Cause the power of Your love has changed me<br/>Oh let my life be lost in the power of the cross</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Lord most high<br/>Hope of man<br/>You are my Redeemer and Savior<br/>All my days are in Your hand<br/>All my praise will be Yours forever</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Where mercy was great and grace was free<br/>Where pardon was multiplied to me<br/>Where my burdened soul found liberty<br/>Hide me in the power of the cross</lines>
    </verse>
