    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>So carry your candle run to the darkness<br/>Seek out the hopeless confused and torn<br/>Hold out your candle for all to see it<br/>Take your candle and go light your world<br/>Take your candle and go light your world</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There is a candle in every soul<br/>Some brightly burning some dark and cold<br/>There is a Spirit who brings a fire<br/>Ignites a candle and makes His home</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Frustrated brother see how he's tried to<br/>Light his own candle some other way<br/>See now your sister she's been robbed and lied to<br/>Still holds a candle without a flame</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>So carry your candle run to the darkness<br/>Seek out the lonely the tired and worn<br/>Hold out your candle for all to see it<br/>Take your candle and go light your world<br/>Take your candle and go light your world</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>We are a fam'ly whose hearts are blazing<br/>So let's raise our candles and light up the sky<br/>Praying to our Father in the name of Jesus<br/>Make us a beacon in darkest times</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>So carry your candle run to the darkness<br/>Seek out the helpless deceived and poor<br/>Hold out your candle for all to see it<br/>Take your candle and go light your world<br/>Carry your candle run to the darkness<br/>Seek out the hopeless confused and torn<br/>Hold out your candle for all to see it<br/>Take your candle and go light your world<br/>Take your candle and go light your world</lines>
    </verse>
