    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In those days:<br/>When Elijah came to Herob the mountain of God, he lodged into a cave;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>and behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and he said, "Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the mountains,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>and broke in pieces the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>and after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>And when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>The word of the Lord<br/>All: Thanks be to God</lines>
