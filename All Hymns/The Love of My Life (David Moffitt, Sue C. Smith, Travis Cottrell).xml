      <lines>Whenever You call my name, <br/>I cannot resist You. <br/>You are irrestiable. <br/>Whatever You have to say, <br/>Iwon't contradict You.<br/>That would be unthinkable. <br/>I was lost, now I'm found. <br/>You have turned my life around. <br/>Sun comes up, sun goes down. <br/>Knowing You is all that matters.</lines>
