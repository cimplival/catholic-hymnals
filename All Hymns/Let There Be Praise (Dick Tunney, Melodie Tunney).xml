    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Let there be praise<br/>Let there be joy in our hearts<br/>Sing to the Lord<br/>Give Him the glory<br/>Let there be praise<br/>Let there be joy in our hearts<br/>Forevermore let His love fill the air<br/>And let there be praise<br/>Let there be praise</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He inhabits the praise of His people<br/>And dwells deep within<br/>The peace that He gives none can equal<br/>His love it knows no end<br/>So lift your voices with gladness sing<br/>Proclaim through all the earth<br/>That Jesus Christ is King</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When the Spirit of God is within us<br/>We will overcome<br/>In our weakness His strength will defend us<br/>When His praise is on our tongue<br/>So lift your voices with gladness sing<br/>Proclaim through all the earth<br/>That Jesus Christ is King</lines>
