  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>How wide is Your love<br/>That You would stretch Your arms<br/>And go around the world<br/>And why for me<br/>Would a Savior's cry be heard<br/>I don't know<br/>Why You went where I was meant to go<br/>I don't know why You love me so</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Those were my nails, that was my crown<br/>That pierced Your hands and Your brow<br/>Those were my thorns, those were my scorns<br/>Those were my tears that fell down<br/>And just as You said it would be<br/>You did it all for me<br/>And after You counted the cost<br/>You took my shame, my blame on my cross</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>How deep is Your grace<br/>That You could see my need<br/>And choose to take my place<br/>And then for me<br/>These words I'd hear You say<br/>Father no<br/>Forgive them for they know not what they do<br/>I will go because I love them so</lines>
    </verse>
