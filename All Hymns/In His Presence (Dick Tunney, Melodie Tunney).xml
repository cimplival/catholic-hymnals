    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>In Your presence there is comfort<br/>In Your presence there is peace<br/>When we seek to know Your heart<br/>We will find such blessed assurance<br/>In Your holy presence Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In the quiet of this hour<br/>As I kneel before You now<br/>I believe Your promise to be faithful<br/>I don't always understand<br/>What Your perfect will demands<br/>But I've learned to trust You more<br/>In Your presence Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There can be such sweet reward<br/>When we wait upon the Lord<br/>As we take the time<br/>He gives His perfect wisdom<br/>To be found in Him alone<br/>All our deepest secrets known<br/>We're surrounded by His grace<br/>When we seek His face</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="e1">
      <lines>In Your presence there is comfort<br/>In Your presence there is peace<br/>When we seek the Father's heart<br/>We will find such blessed assurance<br/>An ever-open door<br/>To know our Savior more<br/>In the presence of our Lord</lines>
    </verse>
