      <lines>I've got something to sing about<br/>I've got something to shout about<br/>I've got something to tell the world about<br/>I've got something to live for<br/>I've got something worth dying for<br/>I've got something to tell the world about</lines>

    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>He lives He lives I know my Savior lives<br/>He lives He lives His life has set me free<br/>I've got something to sing about<br/>I've got something to shout about<br/>I've got something to tell the world about<br/>I stand here forgiven<br/>Abundant life I'm liven'<br/>Because He lives all these things I've found</lines>

    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>There have been many who claimed<br/>That they were God but in those graves<br/>Their bones remain but in the tomb<br/>Where my Jesus once was laid<br/>There's nothing there that's why I have to say</lines>
