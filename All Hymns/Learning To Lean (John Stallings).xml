    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I'm learning to lean<br/>Learning to lean<br/>Learning to lean on Jesus<br/>Finding more power<br/>Than I'd ever dreamed<br/>I'm learning to lean on Jesus</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The joy I can't explain fills my soul<br/>Since the day I made Jesus my King<br/>His blessed Holy Spirit is leading my way<br/>He's teaching and I'm learning to lean</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Sometimes we can be like the man who said<br/>My life is full now I have ev'rything<br/>But there is a strong Rock in Jesus my Lord<br/>Thro' my trials I've been learning to lean</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Sad broken hearted so often I've knelt<br/>And I've found God's peace so serene<br/>And all that He asks is a child-like trust<br/>And a heart that is learning to lean</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>There's glorious vict'ry each day now for me<br/>I found His peace so serene<br/>He helps me with each task if only I'll ask<br/>Ev'ry day now I'm learning to lean</lines>
    </verse>
