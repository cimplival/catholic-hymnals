      <lines>It's hard to take the first step<br/>When I don't know the way<br/>Each turn is so uncertain<br/>I learn to walk by faith<br/>But You gave me a promise<br/>That You would never leave<br/>You will lead and guide me<br/>Oh Lord I do believe</lines>

      <lines>Your plans for me are perfect<br/>I never need to fear<br/>For though at times I feel alone<br/>I know that You are near<br/>My heart just wants to follow<br/>I'm willing to obey<br/>Take my hand and lead me<br/>I'll follow all the way</lines>
