      <lines>If I had seen the sunset<br/>On the day that Jesus died<br/>And felt the glow of the sunrise<br/>When the tomb was opened wide<br/>Would I have known You<br/>Would I have seen that<br/>You were more than just a man<br/>You were Lord and King<br/>But now I know You and I can see<br/>That You are Lord of all<br/>You are Lord to me</lines>
